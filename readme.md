##### Promises Presentation
- This repo is a short introduction to Promises 
  as implemented natively in Javascript ES6.

- The Javascript files create a simple application with 
  a call to [this weather API](http://openweathermap.org/appid) to demonstrate a common 
  async issue in Javascript programming. You will need to
  sign up for an API key, and insert it into API_KEY.js 

- Loading the index.html file in your browser and
  changing the commented out App file inside of the
  script tags, will toggle between a standard API call
  and a Promisified one.

- Accompanying slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/makersquare.com/presentation/d/1DhzGLatUrQcex6HXKRdQsoZou_DZjrEJEhdgLQGpv1w/edit?usp=sharing).

- If you would like to expand upon this, in lieu of repeatedly 
  calling the API during development, you can use the data
  inside of forecast.json
